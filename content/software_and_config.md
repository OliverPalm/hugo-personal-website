### Window Managers VS Desktop Enviorments
Having used Windows for most of my life I though a desktop enviorment worked just fine, but I nonetheless hade a feeling that one could do better. This feeling lead me to look for alternatives (window managers) where I found [Hyprland](https://hyprland.org/).

Honestly no complaints. It works out of the box, easy to configure, looks greate with minimal changes, and is a joy to use. My personal config file can be found [here](https://github.com/OliverPalm/hyprland-config).

### Editors
Much ink has been spiled franticaly arguing why one editor is objectively better than another, so let me not add wood to an eternaly roaring flame. I use vim (nvim for the pedantic), and more specificaly I use [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/). It works like a charm and has all the features I need.
